# Finding a Company ID

## What is a company_id?

In LinkedIn, each company is associated with a global unique id that's called a **company_id** in our API. For example, the company_id of "Apple" is **162479**. It's used in some endpoints like "Search Employees", "Search Jobs", or "Search Posts" to filter the records by company.

## How to find it?

Simply go to this free [people search page](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/PEOPLE/?currentCompany=%5B%22162479%22%5D&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&sid=bv3), put in your target company name (i.e Apple) and you'll see the company_id in the address bar.
