# Finding a Geo Code

## What is a geo_code?

In LinkedIn, each location, region or country is associated with a global unique id that's called a **geo_code** in our API. For example, the geo_code of United States is **103644278**. It's used a lot in different endpoints like "Search Employees", "Search Companies", or "Search Jobs" to filter the records by location.

## How to find it?

Simply go to [LinkedIn website](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3662502499&geoId=103644278&keywords=IT&location=United%20States&refresh=true), put in your target location (i.e United States) and you'll see the geo_code in the address bar.
